This is because as a group we have always recognized the invaluable contribution made by immigrants to our society. We have demonstrated this through measures aimed at protecting the cultural identity of the various ethnic communities that have contributed to the development of our country.
Canada does have a very good reputation for tolerance and willingness to accept differences. However, I believe there is much room for improvement. It is not enough to want to preserve the cultural and linguistic heritage of our immigrants. We must also promote their integration in our society, and that leaves much to be desired.
Recently, I read to my amazement in an article in the Vancouver Sun that a number of immigrants, originally from the state of Punjab in India, were unable or hardly able to speak English, after living in Vancouver for five years.
It is therefore imperative that language training in one or both official languages be made available to all classes of immigrants, because failure to do so will ghettoize them and turn them into second class citizens.

It has been said, quite rightfully, that the capital gains tax is a tax on the life savings of the farmer. Farmers entering retirement should be able to do so with the fruits of their labour intact. For the new or expanding farmer, the capital gains tax only further inflates the already high price of land.
The 300,000 farmers of Canada and their families contribute much to the life of our country. The economic spinoffs of farm capital gains tax removal would be many and obvious. I support the proposal of the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) to study the capital gains tax. However, many farmers presently involved in land transactions are uncertain whether to proceed, and they are stalling their sales until the future of this tax is settled. I call on all Hon. Members of this House to consider the capital gains tax removal thoroughly and expeditiously, so that land will sell and farmers can again act with confidence.

On the one hand it has recognized the importance of tourism to Canada by establishing a Ministry of State for Tourism, but it now appears intent on killing it by the death of a thousand cuts. Last Thursday in its economic statement the Government announced a number of cuts in services which will affect this area. Federal programs in the area of wildlife, water, and environmental protection are being cut, and user fees for the services of Parks Canada, fishing permits, and tourist aviation, are being increased dramatically. Five wildlife centres are being eliminated, one of which received over 40,000 visitors this year.
The Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion (Mr. Stevens) announced last Friday that tourism projects will no longer be eligible for funding under the Industrial and Regional Development Program. My fear is that the Government will be creating a lot of verbal hoop-la over tourism, encouraging Canadians to travel within Canada and visitors to come to Canada, yet will be reducing services, eliminating sites and, in the whole process, making destinations less enjoyable.

As New Democrats, we are asking the Government to start supporting the tourism and hotel industry with actions, not just words.

The study was very limited in scope and mandate and, for that reason, the present Minister of Transport (Mr. Mazankowski) rightfully discontinued it.
Due to the status of this Act, and because of the great numbers of CN employees and pensioners who are affected by the current plan, I would respectfully urge the Minister of Transport to proceed as quickly as possible to set up a new study group with a broader mandate, in order to investigate the situation fully and to recommend appropriate changes.

The leaders of the two territorial Governments were not invited to this important meeting, nor, to my knowledge, is it at all certain they will be invited to the summit early in 1985.
May I remind the House of statements made by the Government in the Speech from the Throne as follows: ""The reality of Canada is one of distinct regional identities"", and: ""A national consensus is also needed to reduce the persistent isolation of Canada's regions"". By not inviting the territorial leaders to the meeting yesterday, the Government has demonstrated that its concept of national purpose, co-operation, and consensus building, excludes the people of Canada's north.

It has a law which permits over 60,000 abortions to be performed each year in hospitals. In addition, it is estimated that there are enough illegal terminations of pregnancy to raise the total to 100,000 abortions a year.
In two provinces, Quebec and Ontario, it has been impossible to persuade a jury to arrive at a guilty verdict. We, therefore, do not have an effective law on abortion. It is imperative that Parliament and other authorities of the law address this intolerable situation. The Canadian people should not have to live and behave in doubt as to what the law requires. Parliament should not be indifferent to the law of the land being broken with impunity. Leadership is required to develop a national consensus that will support an effective law on abortion.
I am one who believes that human life begins in the womb before birth and should be protected by the law. I am also one who believes that the law can protect only when it has the support of the public. This is clearly a time for Canadians to address the issue of what protection we, as a people, are ready to give the unborn.

his economic statement of last week the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) told Canadians that they would have to work together in common cause, shoulder to shoulder, in order to build a more prosperous future. Everyone, we were told, would have to sacrifice and share the burden of restraint. Unfortunately the Minister's words had a hollow ring when we learned last week that some Canadians are sacrificing much more than others. IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd., an organization which studies and reports on the world's major banks, released figures which showed that, taken together, Canada's banks reaped the largest profits of banks in any country within the international banking community last year. Canada's six leading banks showed, on average, a real rate of return well above levels earned by United States, Japanese or British banks or, for that matter, any other national banking system.
When you consider, Mr. Speaker, that Canada now has the highest level of real interest rates of any western industrialized country, these figures come as no surprise. What is surprising, however, is the Government's inaction in the face of these real interest rate levels. Home owners, small business people, consumers, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, all suffer when interest rates are at their current historic levels.
It is time that Canada's banks were asked to share the burden of restraint like everyone else. On September 4 Canadians voted for change. They gave the Government a mandate to put the economy back on the rails. The first step must be a reduction in real interest rates to traditional levels. The Government has said we need lower interest rates, but so far it has done nothing to indicate that it is prepared to have a made-in-Canada interest rate policy. It is time that the Conservatives go beyond the rhetoric-

These agreements generally provide that a person who lived in a foreign country and also lived in Canada during his working life could claim social security benefits from both Canada and the foreign country, based on the number of years in each country.
Perhaps the most well known of these agreements is the one with Italy which has proven most beneficial to those Canadians of Italian origin. Many of those persons have lived in Canada for over 20 years. They are approaching retirement, and are today finding it difficult to get the necessary papers organized with respect to their Italian pension claims. To some extent the Government of Italy has been helpful in supplying assistance in Montreal, Toronto, and Hamilton, but that assistance is provided separate and apart from the pension office run by the Department of National Health and Welfare.
In my view the Government of Canada ought to employ, in its pension offices, people conversant with foreign tongues, who can explain the agreements to pension applicants and make sure applicants are able to obtain the full benefits they are entitled to under the agreements. I therefore call upon the Minister of National Health and Welfare (Mr. Epp) to take action as soon as possible to staff offices in such manner so that Canadians can be assisted in filing the necessary papers-

Despite these clear cut, straightforward decisions, the people of Namibia are still struggling for their independence, and South Africa is still thumbing its nose at world opinion and the vast majority of world nations. These delays are intolerable. They are caused principally by South Africa and the 1982 policy of President Reagan to support South Africa by linking the removal of South African troops from Namibia with the removal of Cuban troops from Angola, where there should be no linkage whatsoever.

I would urge our Government to do three things. First, support those Americans who are trying to change their Government's linkage policy. Two, support an economic boycott of South Africa. Three, insist on action by the U.N. contact group to implement Security Council Resolution 435.

With that in mind, and given that there will be a number of Canadians who will lose their jobs as a result of the economic statement and measures contained in it, does the Prime Minister not consider that that information, with the projections which led the Government to discount the importance of the loss of their jobs, is vital information to which they should be given access?

There is another point, no less legitimate I hope, that he should reflect upon. The Minister has explained his intention to try to be as helpful and forthcoming in all of these areas, but there is another principle that I would ask the Hon.

I want to assure the Hon. Member that the geographic location of Mr. Lassande will not inhibit the work I asked him to do. The Hon.

At that time I determined whether or not there was an opportunity to see if the mine could be saved and reopened. My conclusion, as a preliminary finding, was that there was a possibility. It was on that ground that I asked for the services of Mr. Lassonde. I indicated to him that I wanted to have him go to all parties to the action to see what was possible. I constrained him in no way in bringing forward to me those actions which he thinks would be desirable in order to facilitate the opening of the mine.

The people of Atlantic Canada, in particular those people in the island provinces of Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, view CN Marine and the region's ferry services as an extension of the Trans-Canada Highway. Last Thursday the Minister of Finance announced a $37 million cut-back with respect to this essential Atlantic Canadian service.
The Minister indicated the cut-backs were possible as a result of selective increased cost recoveries.

As a matter of fact, there will be an additional three new vessels on the Gulf service and one new vessel on the Newfoundland-Labra-dor coastal service. These vessels will be of the latest state of the art; they will be faster, they will be larger, and they will provide more flexibility and more reliable service. Not only that, this will have a tremendous impact upon the shipbuilding industry and, therefore, will create jobs.
The implementation will be phased in over a three-year period. It will be done in conjunction and in consultation with representatives of the provinces. With respect to the fare increases, there is a proposal for additional fare increases, but it will be done on a basis whereby the regular user will be provided with a discount, and there will be some market flexibility in the application of those new fares.

WILSON (ETOBICOKE CENTRE)-RULING BY MR. SPEAKER,,"I am now ready to rule on the point of order raised by the Hon. Member for Hamilton Mountain (Mr. Deans) on November 13. The Hon. Member alleged that the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), in answering a question from the Hon. Member for Oshawa (Mr. Broadbent), quoted from an official document and therefore had an obligation to table that document.
Having carefully examined the exchanges which took place between the Hon. Member for Oshawa and the Minister of Finance, it is evident to me that the Minister, while referring to a departmental memorandum, did not in fact quote from it. He stated that the memorandum was ""statistically insignificant"", and added that it indicated a marginal positive increase in employment for 1985 and a marginal negative impact on unemployment for 1986. This, I submit, may be a reference or a paraphrase, but it does not constitute a quotation. Therefore, the Minister is under no obligation to table it as is made clear in Citation 327(3) of Beauchesne's Fifth Edition, which states:
A public document referred to, but not cited or quoted by a Minister, need not be tabled.
Citation 327(5) adds:
To be cited, a document must be quoted or specifically used to influence debate.

November 14, 1984
Petitions
I submit that when a Minister uses a document to supply information in replying to a question in the House, the use of that document cannot be construed as an attempt to influence debate. This view is supported by a ruling given by one of my predecessors, Mr. Speaker Jerome, on April 8, 1976, when he said that:
Reference to a document has never been held to apply to a situation in which a Minister has simply been asked a question about a document and given an answer.
The Hon. Member for Hamilton Mountain alleged in making his point of order that the Minister cited the memorandum, and I quote the Hon. Member:
-in an effort to influence the debate which is presently taking place in the House of Commons and also to influence the public of Canada in believing that the reference to which he referred was of little consequence.
He went on to say that the questions directed to the Minister were, and I quote:
-very much a part of the ongoing debate in public terms over the relevance and import of the economic statement of the Minister of Finance.
It seems to me that when a Minister is specifically questioned about a document and he refers to that document in the course of his reply, it would be difficult to find that he was attempting to influence debate. Furthermore, Beauchesne's Citation 327(5) applies only to debate in the House and not to debate in the country at large. Using a document to influence the public and using a document to influence debate during debate in the House of Commons are not the same thing, and the authority of the Chair cannot be exercised in relation to the former.
Given all of these circumstances, therefore, 1 must rule that the Minister is not compelled to lay this particular memorandum on the table unless he chooses to do so.

I would also like to congratulate the mover and seconder of the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. May I make particular mention of the

seconder, the Hon. Member for Montreal-Mercier (Mrs. Jacques), who gave a very strong speech, particularly in light of the fact that she is, 1 believe, the youngest Member of this House.
In replying to the Throne Speech, Mr. Speaker, and in addressing this House for the first time in this Parliament, 1 would like to take this opportunity to thank the people of New Westminster-Coquitlam for returning me to this place and honouring me with their trust and support. I am honoured and proud to continue to serve them.
During the recent election campaign, promises were made by all Parties. We, on our side, promised to represent and fight for the ordinary people of Canada, to fight for fair taxes, equality for women, the preservation of social services, disarmament and peace. We are living up to our promises.
What can we say of the Conservatives and their promises and the way they have lived up to them? Campaigning this summer, the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) said that universal social services for Canada were ""a sacred trust that would be maintained by a Conservative Government"". Only weeks later we see this Government moving to negotiate and, perhaps, abandon this sacred trust.
The Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald), while speaking in my riding during the election campaign, told pensioners that fears that the Conservatives would cut social services was ""a lot of garbage"" and ""over my dead body would they cut them"". Dead body or not, it is that Minister who is responsible for a lot of garbage as we see Tory plans for cuts to social services and cuts in her own department now enfolding.
What of fair taxes? During a televised debate with the other two Party leaders, the Prime Minister promised to move to ensure that the wealthiest Canadians, many of whom pay no income tax, would pay tax and ""would pay handsomely"". We see no promise of that in the Throne Speech, nor indeed in the economic statement of the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) the other evening.
The Tory list of deception and broken promises is already long, but nowhere is it more shameful than in the broken promises to Canadian women. An early promise by the Prime Minister for contract compliance to achieve affirmative action in firms doing business with the federal Government has been reneged on. Canadian women are still waiting to be paid equally for work of equal value. They are still waiting for increased pensions and for growth and funding in child care. One might argue that all Parties, particularly those which hope to form a government, make a lot of promises which they cannot then keep. However, one cannot accept that something which is a sacred trust one day becomes expendable the next day. What that does, Mr. Speaker, and what causes us the most concern, is this. Far from engendering confidence in Canadian society, the kind of confidence which this Government is talking about engendering, it breeds cynicism. How can the Canadian electorate take a government seriously when on one day it says universality is a sacred trust, and the next day that it is negotiable?
The Address-Ms. Jewett
On jobs, Mr. Speaker, the Conservatives' deception has been thoroughly addressed by my Leader and other Members of my Party in their remarks. With grand claims to put thousands and thousands of Canadians back to work, to create new jobs and new prosperity, the Conservatives won the support of many Canadians. The Throne Speech gave no substance to these promises and the Minister of Finance buried them unceremoniously last week. The true Tory job policy is really 19th century free market economics.

The famous large-scale monopoly private sector will take care of job creation, just as the Iron Ore Company of Canada has taken care of job creation in Schefferville, and just as B.C. Packers is taking care of jobs on the West Coast.
Now, the kind of initiative the Government could take, and which we have been urging it to take, the kind of initiative the people of Canada expect from their government, could be both direct and indirect support for the forest industry, to take a very important example, and particularly the forest industry in British Columbia. I would like to give one example of the tragedy that is taking place in this industry and in the industries that serve it.
A New Westminster-based supplier of pulp and paper machinery, Lamb-Cargate Industries, a recent casualty of this Government's high interest rate policy, is a key manufacturing industry not only in my riding but in the province and in the country. It is being prevented from competing in our own domestic markets by the high interest rate policy of this Government. Foreign pulp and paper machine manufacturers benefiting from lower interest rates in their own countries, indeed in some cases subsidized interest rates, are winning manufacturing contracts in our own province and country. Lower interest rates, assistance to the forest industry, and real national economic planning, Mr. Speaker, are what Canadians need and expect from the federal Government.
In this Parliament I am proud to continue to speak for my Party on external affairs in general and on Canada's nuclear disarmament and international development assistance policies in particular. I am concerned, indeed alarmed, at the emerging shape of the Government's foreign policy.
Before I address those concerns, let me point out that there are some things upon which all Parties in this House agree. Such unanimity is felt at the time of great loss. The sad and untimely death of Indira Gandhi, the outstanding woman in politics in our time and the leader of the world's largest democracy, is a loss not only to the Indian people; in all corners of this House we share that loss. We are concerned as well with the continuing violence in India, and we have had many moderate members of the Sikh community in this country talk to us about that violence. I would hope that all of us, many of us having East Indian and Sikh constituents, would agree that what is needed is a fact-finding mission on
222

behalf of Parliament to go to India and collect the facts upon which we can then make our judgments about what assistance we can give to the people of India. I would hope it would be an all-party fact-finding mission established within the next few weeks or at most few months.
As I say, on many matters we are in accord. On many more we are not. The shadow of war grows in Central America. The danger of a regional war directly involving the United States is more likely now than ever before. Continuing military conflict, covert war, border attacks and grotesque violations of human rights are the reality in Central America. Despite congressional reprimand and international outcry over the mining of Nicaragua's harbours earlier this year, the Reagan administration continues to escalate its military aggression, economic sabotage and attacks on Nicaragua. This poses a danger not only to Nicaraguan sovereignty and independence but to the rule of international law, the self-determination of a people, initial efforts towards development and democracy, and the peace and stability of the western hemisphere.
Honduras has become militarized by the United States to the point where its fledgling democracy and economy are threatened. In Guatemala, massacres and large-scale human rights violations continue and have been well documented.
What has been this Government's response to the crisis in Central America? First, it has refused to increase our diplomatic and political representation in the region. While haggling goes on about Canada's representation in the winegrowing regions of France, this Government accepts that Canada will have no representation except an occasional monthly call in El Salvador, Honduras or Nicaragua. What that means is that the Conservatives, like the Liberals before them, will continue to rely on the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Defence Department and the White House for information on and assessment of this critical region. The Tories are simply continuing an earlier Liberal Minister's policy, that of Mark MacGuigan, of ""quiet acquiescence"" in Washington's policies on Central America.
Secondly, one of the first foreign policy decisions of this Government was its refusal to send observers to the recent Nicaraguan elections. Although earlier this year Canada had sent official observers to the elections in El Salvador, this Government declined the same courtesy to Nicaragua. The Conservative Government prejudged the process and the outcome of the election and once again acquiesced to Washington's wishes.
Thirdly, the Government has failed Canadians and the cause of peace in Central America in an even more fundamental way. Earlier this year all parties in this House were in agreement that the Contadora group's efforts were the only realistic path to peace in Central America. All parties claimed support for these efforts. In September of this year, when the Contadora foreign ministers presented a proposed peace plan for Central America, the countries of the region expressed approval. Nicaragua in particular, much to the surprise of the United States, agreed to the plan. France and other European nations have endorsed it but the United States, which had
earlier asked for and succeeded in getting certain elements in the peace plan, refused to then support it when Nicaragua accepted it. They said that there were verification problems. What verification problems? France and other countries have not raised this question. The countries in the region, members of the Contadora groups, have not raised this as a problem. Only the Americans are raising it as a problem and this Government, in the words of the Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Clark) yesterday, echoing Washington, has begun raising it as a problem.
What this Government does not seem to realize is that Washington has wanted to delay indefinitely implementation of the Contadora peace plan. For proof of this one need go no further than an article in the Washington Post on November 13 which revealed the contents of a paper presented by the National Security Council of the U.S. for an October 30 meeting of that Council at which President Reagan presided. This paper, which to my knowledge has so far been made available only to the Washington Post, credits U.S. foreign policy with success in blocking efforts by Venezuela, Panama, Colombia and Mexico-that is, the Contadora group-to obtain early signing of a proposed regional peace treaty in Central America. It actually states that the United States has been successful in blocking the peace plan.
The paper goes on to say that problems remain in getting the four core contries, that is Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and El Salvador, to agree on a position consistent with U.S. policy against Nicaragua, the fifth potential signatory. There are problems with getting the core countries to agree with the U.S. policy of attacking, undermining and destroying Nicaragua.
In considering its policy vis-a-vis Central America, perhaps the Government will read some of these documents, such as the one I have just quoted from, a document of the U.S. National Security Council, rather than what they are fed by the State Department, Defence Department and White House.
1 believe this is an example of breeding cynicism in our own electorate. Members of the House will recall that when the Prime Minister spoke at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish on September 28 of this year, he said that his ""most cherished ambition is to reduce the threat of war and enhance the promise of peace"".
But, if the Government is failing Canadians and peace in Central America, it is also failing Canadians in other aspects of the quest for peace, such as the urgent necessity for nuclear disarmament. It is interesting that the Government has chosen two admirable and skilful spokespeople for its policies in this field, not the least of whom is the new Canadian ambassador to the United Nations and indeed the new ambassador for disarmament. While we applaud these choices, if the Government really feels it is essential to go outside of the External Affairs Department, we cannot applaud the policies and actions, or rather inactions, that go with them.
November 14, 1984

The Secretary of State for External Affairs (Mr. Clark), speaking at the United Nations on September 25 with regard to aid policy and Canadian development assistance, said that ""despite serious economic problems at home, we shall not turn our backs on the world's disadvantaged people"". He went on to say: ""Our new Government intends to maintain Canada's commitment to reaching .7 per cent of the GNP by 1990 in official development assistance"". The Minister of Finance shot that one down in his economic statement, as he shot down the sacred trust of universality. Now the goal is not .7 per cent by 1990, but rather by 1995. This is beginning to sound just like the Liberals. In the early 1970s they had a goal of .7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance. That was consistently lowered to .6, .5 and .43 of 1 per cent of GNP.
Most seriously, will the electorate not again become cynical when our Government says very fine words and then reneges so seriously and damagingly on its promises? What has the Government done in the search for peace in the field of nuclear arms control and disarmament? So far it has not produced any ideas or proposals which would carry Canada and the world forward even a step. In his speech in Vancouver on October 20 the Government had the ambassador for disarmament say that the kind of progress the Government would make in these life and death matters would be inch by inch. In metric that would be centimetre by centimetre or millimetre by millimetre. Indeed, the very title of that speech was to the effect of reaching peace ""inch by inch."" I am sure that the ambassador was almost embarrassed to have to say this, but of course that is government policy.
The second shocking thing about the Government's policy is that it has totally rejected any unilateral initiatives that Canada can take in the field of nuclear arms control and steps toward disarmament. It has totally rejected our own historical tradition where we have, from time to time, taken unilateral initiatives. It says that those are no longer possible and we cannot take any initiatives on our own as Canadians, whether it is rejecting Cruise missile testing or bringing nations together to promote a nuclear freeze.

These challenges and difficulties are without parallel in the history of most Canadians. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, this Government has taken office to meet those challenges and difficulties because the voters of Canada recognized that the old ideas and ways had reduced our economy to a shambles
The Address-Miss MacDonald and in the process had cost many hundreds of thousands of Canadians their homes, jobs, businesses, dreams, and even their hopes.
It is no wonder that when Canadians went to the polls on September 4 they did indeed vote for change. Hon. Members opposite have acknowledged this. With less than three score and ten of them, they have no alternative but to do so. The message of the electorate was unequivocal. The people of Canada voted for change. They voted for a government that they could believe in again, but they voted for more than that. They voted as well for a government that would believe in
them.
Therefore, I stand in the House today to make my first speech as Minister of Employment and Immigration mindful of the enormous task of rebuilding and reinvigorating that lies ahead of us. However, I am confident that with the strength and belief of the Canadian people behind us we shall succeed in our duty. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, we must succeed in that duty. Unemployment of 11.3 per cent, 10 per cent, 9 per cent or 8 per cent is a tragedy that we cannot afford and must not tolerate. We cannot afford its continuing cost in human terms of ruined lives and the despair in many regions which is almost incomprehensible in a land that is so truly great-a land which we all grew up to believe held unlimited possibilities.
But that despair is real. It is the legacy of ministers and cabinets dedicated to the belief that the government-the bigger the better-knows best. It is the result of unilateral policies that promised one thing and delivered another, such as high interest rates, which ruined tens of thousands of businesses, put hundreds of thousands of people out of work and in three or four short years left a national debt which is both a millstone and an albatross around our necks.
No, the old ways will not do. They did not work in the past and they will not work in the future. The people of this country do not want them any more. They did indeed vote for change. They voted for a government which will meet the challenges of today and those of tomorrow; a government which will ensure that productive, remunerative, worth-while and prideful work will remain a fundamental element in our daily lives.
As Minister of Employment and Immigration I will accept no less objective. However, I want to emphasize that I do not underestimate the momentous task ahead if we are to achieve this objective. We know today's unemployment only too well. We all label it intolerable or unbearable, as indeed it is. What,
then,	shall we say tomorrow if hundreds of thousands more Canadians were to be left without work and without the skills needed to work because the technological revolution passed them by? What, then, would be the economic and social reality?
Over the past five years those ministers responsible for addressing this challenge either did not recognize it and its dimensions or simply did not care. Today we are paying for that failure and for that indifference. We are starting out already late in the race for the future. If we do not begin to

November 14, 1984
The Address-Miss MacDonald hold our own and to catch up in the next five years, then the race as far as Canada is concerned will be over. We must put Canadians back to work. We must keep Canadians in work.
That requires two objectives. First, we must remove the obstacles to economic growth. We welcome investment. We restore an atmosphere which shows that Canada is once again a good place to do business. We build better, sell better. We manage our own affairs, our own economy above all, in a professional and competent manner. In other words, we build confidence at home and internationally, confidence in Canada itself and in the ability of its people.
This development of economic resources was highlighted by my colleague, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), last Thursday. I may say that in that one address we heard more sound commonsense on economic matters than we heard in the whole of the previous four and one-half years by all the former Ministers of Finance.
If the first condition we must meet in our quest to create employment for all Canadians is economic development, then the second is the development of our human resources. Indeed, the two are inseparable. Without the skills we cannot fill the jobs and without the jobs in a growing economy we will not create new opportunities.
The world of work is changing. The place of work is changing. In the future, what we do and how we do it may change not just once or twice during our lifetime but over and over again. Skills will not be static. They must be developed and upgraded on a continuing basis. Every working Canadian, young and old, male and female, must expect and indeed accept new training and retraining as part of their working lives.
That is what it is. It is part of our working lives. The era in which we went to school, acquired our skills and then worked 30 or 40 years in the same job is at an end. In the information age that we are rapidly entering, today's skills are but a stepping stone to tomorrow's and not an end in themselves. We, as a society and as individuals, must be prepared to accept this fact and to accept this challenge.
Clearly, it is an enormous undertaking. Some estimates suggest that fully 5 per cent of our annual GNP will eventually be directed to training and retraining. There is no question that the task is huge or that the time is short. Virtually nothing has been done to prepare our society to meet the scope of this challenge of human resource development. However, our Government is determined to make up for lost time.
The enormity and complexity of this task will require the co-operation and determination of all sectors of our society. The old unilateralism just will not work. To meet this challenge, I have already launched a process of consultation. Over the coming months I will meet with provincial ministers, business and labour leaders and with groups from the community. The challenge is common and so must be the solution.
It is obvious why we must consult with the provinces. Basic education, the foundation upon which we prepare for our working lives, rests with the provinces, as does most of our
post-secondary education. The role of community colleges and technological schools is already expanding and will become even more critical in the years ahead.
Training and retraining does not begin and end only in the classroom. The responsibility cannot rest solely with governments. Industry has a vital interest in contributing to a trained labour force. Training will be an ongoing part of work and if industry will share this responsibility government will share the cost of this human investment.
In the future, training and retraining will not be restricted to schools and institutions. It will also take place on the shop floor and in the office. If for no other reason, this would require the participation of organized labour.
Labour has an even greater role to play. The trade union movement in Canada has helped to shape our lives. It will continue to do so as we face the challenges of tomorrow and labour's participation can help ensure that we maximize the opportunities of technological change, be it through better working conditions or a new equality in the workplace.
The goals we are striving for are basic. We must ensure that we have a skilled labour force which can meet the needs of the future. We must stimulate economic growth, a dynamic force for the creation of new job opportunities. We must also ensure equality of opportunity, equality in competition and equality of access to jobs. We have a national challenge and it will take a national commitment to meet it.
The federal Government has signalled its determination to meet our share of this national challenge and national commitment. We have already allocated an additional $1 billion for employment development. But our commitment is to people as well as to providing money. When I talk about investing in people, I think of those groups in our society today who are at a particular economic disadvantage-groups which need a particular commitment.
I should like to mention just three of them: youth, older workers, and women. Youth unemployment is a continuing tragedy. Many young Canadians still lack training and practical experience. They are having trouble getting their first job. They need to prove their worth and their competence. They need to get on with their lives. Dealing with youth unemployment requires more than the random spending of dollars. What happens when our young people leave school? How can we help them make that transition from school to work? What about those who do not go on to post-secondary education?
We are considering a number of options, Sir, which will be set out in a discussion paper on training and which I will be releasing shortly. These include a new emphasis on co-operative education measures and on apprenticeship. Employer-based training is another concept which merits study and consideration. Through the process of consultation and commitment with the other players in our economy, we will find the answers to this critical waste of talent and potential which we see now.
November 14, 1984

Now 1 come to our older workers. Many older Canadians now find that they need new skills in mid-career. These Canadians are still travelling along the old road; that is, school, one career, and then retirement. They have crashed headlong into the future world of work. How do we equip these people for new employment opportunities? How do we keep our work force skilled, current, employed and employable? One avenue which we will explore is that of skill development leave. We also recognize that business must be more involved in training. Training as well for those with special needs should be available if we are to meet our responsibilities to all Canadians. With regard to new employment opportunities, one way to encourage the private sector is through an employment tax credit.
In any discussion of opportunities, Mr. Speaker, there must be an emphasis on what the future means to women. The reality of working women in this country still lags behind the accepted principles of social and economic equality. In this context, I noted this morning's report from the Economic Council of Canada. I am encouraged by the trend that it shows, but we must continue to do much, much more. One cannot be satisfied with the results we saw this morning.
Women need real choices in the future. They should be able to choose both to work and to have children. That is what I mean by real choice. Like all Canadians they must be able to train and to have retraining without suffering economic disadvantages. These are economic realities, and the problem of child care and parental leave are inexplicably linked to the problems of employment for women. But it is not only a so-called women's issue. I cannot emphasize this enough. This is a major employment issue.
The new technologies remove many of the obstacles, real or imaginary, to women. For the first time a revolution in the workplace has occurred which does not impose any physical barriers. In fact, some of the skills that have kept women in low-paying jobs will now be tickets to new opportunities. The computer managed world is one which I think can be of some immense help to women. For women to make the most of it, training opportunities must be expanded as access to the new machines increases. The age of the microchip is still young. For women, I think this is a critical opportunity.
Future prosperity will not be achieved easily, Sir. It never has been, but it is achievable. With the mobilization of our economic and human resources, with a shared sense of purpose and a shared responsibility, we can and we will attain it. The process has begun. The consultations on which I am embarking this month will lay the groundwork for a new atmosphere of mutual trust and co-operation. While they apply in particular to the provinces, I have five objectives clearly before me.
First, to remove obstacles to employment growth and to promote mobility in a growing labour market.
Second, to develop approaches to training which are capable of providing the skills and flexibility required in the years ahead. It is especially critical that we apply this philosophy to small business, the powerhouse of today's employment growth.
The Address-Miss MacDonald
Third, to simplify federal programs and wherever possible to harmonize them with the efforts of the provinces.
Fourth, to ensure equitable access to training and employment opportunities for all Canadians.
Fifth, to reach a consensus on fair sharing of responsibilities between the federal Government and the provinces and our economic and social partners.
These consultations are critical to our development of a workable co-operative training and employment creation strategy. That is what I am aiming for, Mr. Speaker.
But we will also act immediately when obvious need confronts us. The $430 million I have already allocated for Canada Works this winter is an example of such action today. The $1 billion this Government has allocated to employment and human resource development signals our determination to meeting our commitments tomorrow.
The creation of an effective employment strategy for Canada is long overdue. Our need for such a strategy becomes even more critical with every passing day. We are entering a new era in work, a new era in living itself. Our success depends upon our own intelligence and indeed upon our resourcefulness and our willingess to work together.
As a government we have a faith in the future, undiminished by the magnitude of the task and the challenge that confronts us because we know Canadians will work together to accomplish these goals.
All of us share a common tomorrow, and I believe we all share common hopes of that tomorrow. We are all social and economic partners. Our purpose is to secure prosperity for all Canadians. This is the vote for change that was recorded on September 4, and I am optimistic we shall achieve it.

These are high unemployment areas. The only way that someone leaving high school can attend university or trade school is through direct job creation by one of the two governments. Certain provinces in Canada, such as the Province of Newfoundland, have no direct job-creation program for students. That is the only way a student can further his or her education or return to school the following year.
Is the Minister now saying definitely that there will be a direct job-creation program by government for students next summer to replace the one which was just discontinued by the Government? The question is straightforward. It has nothing to do with private enterprise because many of these areas have no private enterprise. These are the poor about whom I am talking now, not students of rich families. I am asking the Minister point blank: Is she saying definitely that there will be a direct job-creation program for students administered by government next summer?

The second part of the question had to do with the National Training Act.

We have agreed jointly to the extension of the National Training Act for one year so that consultations can take place over that which will extend the National Training Act and make any modifications or changes to it that are seen to be needed.
With regard to Canada Works, that is for this winter. It began, of course, in 1984-85. The tail of it has to run over into the next fiscal year.

November 14, 1984
The Address-Mrs. Champagne appointment as Minister of State for Youth. I can assure them of my full co-operation and dedication. I appreciate their support, Mr. Speaker, especially since I will need it to fulfil the mandate I have been given by the Right Hon. Prime Minister of Canada (Mr. Mulroney) to help the young people of this country.
I also wish to say a word of thanks to the people of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot for their trust in electing me on September 4. 1 want them to understand that despite my ministerial responsibilities, I will certainly be available to my constituents. I have also become a member of the rural caucus of my Party in order to serve the farmers in my riding more effectively.
I was very pleased that my colleague, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), announced that the increase in the price of gas will not apply to the gas farmers' need for their operations and that the Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Wise) informed us recently that the Farm Credit Corporation would be stopping most of its recovery activities until next January 15.
My responsibilities as Minister of State for Youth will be exercised within the parameters by which my mandate is defined. 1 shall get back to these as soon as I have indicated the key points of my speech. These reponsibilities arise from the high priority placed by the Prime Minister on youth, a priority that will remain, despite budgetary restrictions that have become absolutely necessary as a result of the financial situation left by the previous Government.
The support every one of us has shown for youth is a good sign. In fact, this support will make it possible for us to approach 1985, designated by the United Nations as International Youth Year, in a spirit of co-operation and enthusiasm. [English]
On September 4, the Canadian people clearly indicated their profound desire for a new approach. The Government has understood this message. We must all take it into account. [Translation]
I think it was Picasso who said that it takes a long time to grow young. The problem is that young people do not have time to wait. At a time when words are often more powerful than ideas, they would not understand, nor would the rest of Canada, if we wasted our time.
My philosophy is one of optimism and realism. My optimism is tempered by reason and arises from my experience with young people, starting with my own children. This common sense optimism leads me to believe, for instance, that the majority of young people who succeed in our society can, through appropriate activities, have a beneficial effect, a snowball effect as it were, on young people who are less fortunate.
My approach to Canadian youth which, I might add, is more to be envied than pitied, generally speaking, as I realized not long ago at the Conference of ministers for youth and
sports from French-speaking countries, held in Gabon my approach will, I hope, be a common sense one.
Mr. Speaker, in connection with the conference I just mentioned, 1 am pleased to announce, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for External Relations (Mrs. Vezina), that Canada will be hosting this conference in 1987. In Libreville the news was welcomed with enthusiasm by all participating countries.

I know my colleague, the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald), will agree with me when I say that in programs aimed at solving youth unemployment, for example, we must discard the shortsighted formulae and those that fail to take into account the training and work experience already acquired by those involved.
My colleague, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), reminded us the other day in his eloquent statement that we must attack the roots of the problems facing us and not just the symptoms. Let me add that we will devote our efforts to co-ordinating our activities on behalf of Canadian youth with those of the provinces, the municipalities and the private sector. We will do everything in our power to make our programs compatible with the long-term development programs of the various regions of Canada.
[ Translation]
Mr. Speaker, I intend to realize these projects as part of the mandate I have been given by the Prime Minister. At the Department of the Secretary of State, I am responsible for co-ordinating the national activities program within the framework of International Youth year and for acting as a spokesperson for youth and for those who work with young people within the Government and Cabinet.
I accept this mandate with enthusiasm. I fully intend to be the spokesperson for young people. I will actively promote their interests and aspirations in the preparation of the Government's political orientations and strategies. I am already committed to that policy. If I am to fulfil that role properly, however, I must also speak to young people on behalf of the Canadian Government. I am anxious to listen to them and learn more about their problems and their achievements. I want to make them see me as a privileged spokesperson who will uphold their viewpoints and aspirations. I want to establish a close relationship with them, with their associations, with the organizations which serve them and with their major social partners in the private and public sectors.
Overly concerned about seeking solutions to their own problems, adults are often wont to forget young people and to leave them on their own. Those young people must regain their rightful role in the activities and the conduct of the affairs of our society. Where there is no such role, they must create one, and it is up to us to help them. Young people have every right to education, employment and decent living conditions. They must have adequate means at their disposal to ensure personal
November 14, 1984

development and take part in the development of their community. It is imperative that they have their say in the decisionmaking process which involves them and has an impact on them. Those last three objectives are priorities for me and they will be the focus of my efforts in the coming months.
Youth in Canada today are really no different from their predecessors, even though living conditions have changed. Young people have always demonstrated their creative and innovative potential and have always played an essential role in the constant adjustments which our societies must make in order to adapt to new realities. In this way, they represent an active and positive force. Their unstinting contribution to society's institutions has two important benefits. On the one hand, it enriches the institutions and pushes them toward renewal; on the other hand, it represents one of the most fundamental investments in their future.
Youth's achievements are often more easily recognized in the highly visible areas of the arts, culture, sports and politics. Yet in the past they have contributed directly to our economic institutions, particularly in areas which have become central today, such as advertising, communications and high technology.
Young people represent a significant portion of our society. Almost one person in five is between the ages of 15 and 24. They generally enjoy good health and a physical condition that compares favourably with that of youth in a number of developed countries. They are more educated than they were in the past and benefit from the positive aspects of our age of communications. However, young people are affected by the insecurities, difficulties and restrictions facing our society as a whole. At a time when they are making plans for their future and the search for personal autonomy is a constant concern, all young people are extremely sensitive to the precariousness of world peace, the vagaries of the current economic situation and the significant shift in social values and behaviour.
Young people today are under an unprecedented amount of stress. For some, it becomes a source of innovation, exceptional achievement and excellence. For others, it is a source of serious problems that lead to isolation, use of drugs and alcohol, delinquency and even suicide.
A large minority of young people do not have equal opportunities to earn an income, nor equal access to jobs and training. Poverty is widespread among young people. As well, unemployment and underemployment among youth are particularly serious as they affect young people's confidence in themselves and their abilities.
Adults and especially our major political, social and economic institutions can do much for young people who are in difficulty. However, I believe that young people can do a great deal for themselves if they are given the means to gain a better self-understanding, to help each other and to use their knowhow and creativity to improve their circumstances.
The Address-Mrs. Champagne
Young people are not a homogeneous group. They are not as readily identifiable with specific ideological and political trends as they were in the past. They are students, workers, entrepreneurs and unemployed people. They live in urban centres and remote areas. They are men, women, natives, disabled and people of different ethnic origins. However, a single important characteristic unites them. Having lived in a state of dependence on their families and social institutions, they are beginnig, and in many cases completing, their transition to personal autonomy. At age 15, 98 per cent of young people live with their parents, while the proportion is only 65 per cent at age 20 and 23 per cent at age 24. The transition to personal autonomy is crucial for young people and for society because it shapes the way in which youth participate in society, now and in the future.
Youth form a unique pool of human resources in a society and this alone is reason to pay special attention to their development and to potential obstacles to it.

I was saying, Mr. Speaker, my philosophy is based on optimistic realism. Any society must be particularly attentive to every new generation of young people. The vigour, the health and the future of any endeavour, whether industrial or cultural, can be judged by the quality and the commitment of those who bring new blood to it. The same is true for a society. I invite my colleagues and every Canadian to look at our youth from that point of view.
There are two other principles underlying my actions: one is a sense of equity and the other a search for excellence. All young people do not have the same potential. However, every youth must have all the opportunities to develop his own potential fully whether rich or poor, male or female, native or immigrant, and so on. Moreover, as a social group, young people must not be viewed as a separate class entitled to fewer rights. For instance, it is no more acceptable to pay a young person less than the minimum wage for his or her work than it would be an adult.
On the other hand, young people must yearn for excellence in their field of activity. Youth is by nature idealistic. This idealism must be encouraged, especially when it leads to creativity, challenge and excellence. These are the major principles underlying my action plan, which is threefold.
First, I shall continue to get involved with young people, with the groups representing them and with our social partners for the purpose of listening to their projects and discussing them, whether they be their own or whether they be carried out by governments or the private sector. My involvement will make it possible for me to examine existing means of action, especially in the various federal departments and agencies. I shall see what they entail and check, in cooperation with my Cabinet colleagues, to what extent they can meet the needs of our young people and how their efficiency can be improved. I shall also identify with them present shortcomings and the

November 14, 1984
The Address-Mrs. Champagne possibility of taking new initiatives to help young people help themselves.
Finally, 1 shall continue to hold bilateral meetings with my counterparts in the provinces and the territories, who are responsible for youth-related matters. I shall attempt to define with them the objectives which we can share and to ensure the relevance and complementary nature of our programs.
Finally, I will endeavour to ascertain whether there is any unnecessary duplication of our respective endeavours. I will therefore be in a position during 1985, the International Youth Year, to put forward specific proposals. They will serve as the basis for long-term planning for the young and will truly help enhance their involvement in all sectors of our society.
The International Youth Year is indeed a unique opportunity for youth to strengthen their self-image and potential, to pave the way for future generations. For us adults, it is a privileged period for improving our awareness of the youth fact, to communicate with them and to foster their integration into society.
I specifically and cordially urge all our young people and all those who are interested in them to take an active part in the celebration of the International Youth Year.
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that if I seem to dwell upon the young people who are doing all right, I also care for the minority of young people-a minority that is always too large, whatever their numbers-who are facing tremendous difficulties. I have in mind the young unemployed, the young faced with poverty, whether they are workers or students, the young whose emotional ties with their families have been severed, those who are withdrawn within themselves and have lost all hope of better days ahead. They deserve special and first hand attention, because without minimum standards a person cannot grow and fully contribute to society. Were we then to stress the lot of these young people only, this might have negative effects, discouraging the young, making them over-conscious of the obstacles confronting them, leading them to ignore the enormous potential of youth generally, with or without problems. This might emphasize short-term solutions rather than solutions that extend in the future, or create a ghetto for the young people whose problems frighten the adult population and deepen the generation gap. This is why, in my view, an approach to youth must also set aside an important place for their creative achievements and contribution. A youth policy must address all of the young, and increase the potential of each and every one.
To summarize, I see my role at various, closely related levels. First, I definitely intend to strive during the International Youth Year to look for solutions that can improve living conditions for all our young people. In that sense, it is my belief that most young people who succeed will help the less privileged within their rank. Second, as Minister of State for Youth, I am committed to direct all of my energy to influencing federal policy orientations pertaining to social, political, cultural and economic activities affecting Canadian youth.

I would like to say how happy I was to hear those remarks because they were made with some degree of conviction. However, during the election campaign, the Leader of the Minister's Party promised ""jobs, jobs, jobs"", and I believe the Canadian youth responded to that and voted en masse for the Conservative Party. However, the Minister ought to know that it was revealed by StatsCanada that there are 600,000 young people unemployed. There are another 300,000 young people who are ""officially unemployed"" but who have not reported this to StatsCanada. Therefore, we are looking at crisis proportions, Mr. Speaker, with 900,000 young people unemployed.
My question to the Minister is: Notwithstanding her conviction to see something realized for young people in this country, does she not believe, as I do, that there is a credibility gap? On the one hand, the Prime Minister (Mr. Mulroney) promises jobs-on page 9 of the Throne Speech there is mention of jobs-and on the other hand, the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) cuts out most of the programs for Employment and Immigration. When will the young people of this country see some concrete, substantive action as opposed to more studies, dialogue and deliberation with the private sector?
I suggest to the Hon. Minister that young people want jobs; they do not want rhetoric!

November 14, 1984

awards, it would receive a very excellent rating because it is very rhetorical. Her speech contained some very lovely, high-flown phrases which mean absolutely nothing. The Minister says she will use the International Year of Youth in order to try to bring about a better understanding of the problems of youth internationally. However, can the Minister tell me what her role was when all the consultation over there was going on to eliminate what looks to me like a very interesting program called ""The Young Workers' Exchange Program""? This was to allow international exchanges for young people.
If there is one thing we need in this country, and in this world, it is better understanding among peoples. One of the places we should start is with young people. I do not want a Pontius Pilate washing of the hands answer that the Minister is going to be a spokesperson. I want to know what voice the Minister had in the consultation. Did she demand from her colleagues that they ought not to eliminate what appears to be a pretty creative kind of program?
Second, all of these studies are now showing, Mr. Speaker, that there is a great correlation between unemployment and juvenile offences. This can all be related back to the fact that young people are not receiving the kind of dignity of being employed in jobs for which they feel they are gifted or in jobs they would like to do. How can the Minister responsible for youth sit there, Mr. Speaker, and wash her hands, saying she will only be a spokesperson? Can this Minister say what she is going to do within her Cabinet to get some of these programs, like the $85 million for the Summer Canada Program, into place before there are any more changes?

I must say that poor Pablo Picasso must be turning in his grave hearing himself quoted by a Conservative Member. But poor Mr. Picasso is gone and will not be able to rise and object. I am interested in the statement of the Minister in which she described herself as the spokesperson for youth in the Government. I am interested in what her position is on some of the issues of concern to young people, particularly funding for higher education.
As the Minister knows, there has been ongoing conflict between federal and provincial levels of government on how transfer payments for post-secondary education have been used for other purposes, such as building highways, by the provinces. In the last session, the Opposition Conservative Party moved a motion requesting the federal government to monitor how the provinces spent the money allocated for this purpose. Does the Minister believe the provinces should be held accountable for the money they receive from the federal Government for post-secondary education? Will she express these views vigorously in Cabinet?

I would like to start my speech by thanking the people of Sainte-Marie for giving me a third mandate to represent their riding in the Parliament of Canada. Today, Mr. Speaker, I want to give them the assurance that I shall continue, as I have done in the past, to work together with the groups in my riding to improve the quality of life of my constituents.
As far as youth is concerned, despite the cuts made by the Conservative government in a number of programs that were not merely needed but desperately needed by the young people in my riding, I can assure them that in conjunction with the Action jeunesse office I set up myself in my riding, we shall continue to increase the number of services offered to these young people. These services include teaching them how to find that first job if only this government would stop raising unemployment; how to find out which subjects to take in high school; and we are also offering various kinds of recreational services.
As far as senior citizens are concerned, they may rest assured, Mr. Speaker, that as in the past, I will be organizing an annual seminar or meeting with all those responsible for taking care of senior citizens, while senior citizens themselves will have an opportunity to attend a meeting and find out about the various programs being offered by all levels of government to help this segment of our population to provide various services appropriate to their needs. I find this is also an opportunity to consult them, to find out about their concerns, and the Government has asked us ... You may be sure that on
February 15, I will have a meeting to inform these people about what the Government intends to do about the universality of old age pensions.
Mr. Speaker, although this Government unfortunately found it necessary to make cuts in subsidized housing, I intend to continue, with the co-operation of municipal and provincial representatives, to ensure that low-cost housing will be built in my riding, as well as co-operative housing projects to meet the needs of families, the handicapped and senior citizens. Mr. Speaker, I also want my constituents to know that right after September 4, with a community group from my area, we set up an organization that will provide advice and assistance for tenants in my riding who are faced with unreasonably high rent increases by a few landlords who are only interested in land speculation. These people may rest assured that they now have an organization that will defend their rights.
As for my role in the House of Commons, I can assure my constituents of Sainte-Marie that when the government introduces satisfactory legislation meeting their needs and expectations, I will support them. On the other hand, if programs, legislation and regulations detrimental to low or average income citizens are introduced, I will oppose them strongly and make sure that the government is fair in trying to meet their needs.
Mr. Speaker, I would now like to refer to the throne speech. I believe, as you and most members in this House do, Mr. Speaker, that everybody was disappointed with that speech. After 20 years in the opposition, many seminars and conventions and the setting up of many committees, I thought, like the new Conservative members, that the Progressive Conservative Party would waste no time and have specific programs ready since they made so many promises and commitments. What do we find in the throne speech? Nothing. There is nothing for a million and a half unemployed, no specific measure for the young or for consumers, nothing about the housing policy, for single parent families, for farmers or fishermen and nothing about pension reform.
Why did Canadians vote for changes? They did so because hon. members opposite had led us to believe that there would be changes for the better, but they are for the worse. It is they who have deceived the public and not the other way around.
Mr. Speaker, everyone knows and all the polls show that Canadians believe the major problem in Canada is unemployment. However, the major problem for business leaders and high finance is the deficit. Who did the Conservatives listen to? They listened to the big wigs, the VIPs; and gave priority to the deficit. I do not believe, Mr. Speaker, that the party opposite ever intended to create jobs.
I have leafed through the throne speech, and I found it interesting in two places. When I read that the Government would organize a tripartite summit attended by labour,
November 14, 1984

consumer and employer representatives, 1 thought that they would finally be able to discuss solutions to the unemployment problem. Not at all. It says in the speech that they will be meeting to determine how the few workers who are left can become more productive. The major purpose of this meeting is not to sit down and discuss how to reduce unemployment. Such a meeting could have provided an opportunity to consider using early retirement to help reduce unemployment. Those involved could have considered using unemployment insurance funds to allow 60-year old workers to retire and make room for young people or for those looking for a job. They could have studied the union recommendations for shorter work week to create more jobs. They could also have discussed work-sharing and many other suggestions. However, the first item on the agenda is the economy and how to reduce the deficit. There is only one good thing in the throne speech, and it seems that this Government is unable to do things to the full even when it tries to do well. I am referring to the spouse's allowance for widows and widowers between 60 and 64. What 1 do not understand, is why single people are penalized. Why discriminate against single pensioners? Why penalize pensioners who are separated or divorced? Why did the Government decide to do so?
1 believe that the Minister should have done something for all of pensioners between the ages of 60 and 64 who live alone whether they are widows or widowers, single, separated or divorced, because they all have needs. 1 trust that he will because I have confidence in the Minister. In fact 1 believe that only one or two members of the Cabinet will defend low-income citizens because all the others belong to the financial establishment.
Mr. Speaker, I always maintain that a picture is worth a thousand words, that a cartoon speaks for itself. Just what is the Speech from the Throne? Well, I have here a cartoon featured in the November 6 Journal de Montreal which shows the Governor General reading the Speech from the Throne. It is a blank piece of paper, and that is what people think of the Speech from the Throne.
And now, the mini-budget. If we keep in mind the promises and commitments of this Government, what does it contain? Higher taxes, fewer jobs, more unemployment, more lay-offs, and 2 cents more for a litre of gas.
When I saw the election results in Quebec, Mr. Speaker, I told myself that we had a champion of gas station operators, the Hon. Member for Duvernay (Mr. Della Noce) who took up the fight of small gas station operators against the multinationals. I thought that the Government would at least have one man to speak up for low-income people. However, I saw him rise and praise the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson) for increasing prices!
What is going on, Mr. Speaker? What is going on? I saw him on TV not so long ago when he said that the multinationals would be cut down to size. He was the one who was cut down to size in a hurry, Mr. Speaker. 1 have heard that he got
The Address-Mr. Malepart
into a new business and bought a Mr. Muffler franchise. He got a contract to muffle 57 Quebec members.
Mr. Speaker, who will pay the increase in unemployment insurance benefits and various services made available by the government? The consumers will. Let us now have a look at the cuts. We should never forget that this government has promised jobs, jobs, jobs. What have they done for our youth? First, the student loans program for students, a rather negligible program, will be reduced by 5 million dollars. The minister has just referred to that and said that it will remain at the same level as last year. But indexation of income tax tables for the rich will be maintained. To do otherwise would be shameful. Students are not rich so they will remain at the same level as last year. School fees as well as transportation costs will not be increased any way, despite the increase in oil prices. However, the Exchange Program for Young Workers is not really important, so it will be abolished and so will the Summer Youth Employment Program with a budget of $85 million because it is unimportant.
Mr. Speaker, I woulk like to read into the record a letter from the chairwoman of the school committee of a polyvalente school in my constituency concerning Summer Canada projects. I quote:
Dear Mr. Malepart:
Having read newspaper reports on cuts in Summer Canada projects for the coming year, I want to tell you that I am shocked by the Government's decision to cancel those projects. Having done volunteer work as member of a school committee over the years, 11 years to be specific, I can say that a good many of our students have been able to attend Cegeps or universities through such projects, which allow them, within a short period of time, to earn the money they need to pay for their registration, textbooks and transportation over a certain period. I would therefore ask you to forward to whomever it may concern our representations for the continuation of Summer Canada projects. Because with the current high unemployment and uncertain future opportunities, we deem it important that the people in this constituency, mostly young people, keep on hoping by furthering their studies. I want to emphasize that as a parent I have done volunteer coordination work for 34 young people working on projects and if 1 had to go through that experience again I would do so, because I can say that, had they not worked this summer most of them would have had to stay home in September because their parents could not afford the cost of attending Cegep or university. It is my hope that the decision is not final. Expecting good news for our students and parents, I am.
Yours truly,
Micheline Mathieu Chairwoman
Home and School Committee Polyvalente Pierre Dupuy
So much for what has been done for our young people.
Let us turn now to our workers. A moment ago, the Minister of Employment and Immigration (Miss MacDonald) emphasized the importance for people who are 55 years old to adapt to technical changes through manpower training. That is all very well, but given that the available resources have been cut by some $40 million, she could have dispensed with that speech. Some $40 million less for on-the-job manpower training! Some $300 million less for unemployment insurance

November 14, 1984
The Address-Mr. Malepart
benefits! They have found someone who could collect $600 in unemployment benefits for a couple weeks. Fancy that! The executioner from Treasury Board said: It is outrageous! Let's save this amount for the presidents of our major banking establishments. It does not make sense.
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister brags about consultation, even in that field. A company in my riding sought the agreement of the union and decided that, instead of laying off 60 employees among those with little seniority, it would urge workers aged 55 or more to take early retirement, and it offered them a cash settlement for leaving their jobs, in addition to allowing them to draw benefits from the private pension plan. But with the new measure, those people stand to lose $12,000, so they are quite reluctant now. As a result, young employees with little or no seniority will be laid off, yet 126 people had willingly agreed to go on early retirement. That is just another senseless measure taken by this Government.
When it comes to housing, Mr. Speaker, social housing does not weigh heavily in the balance.
In the City of Montreal and surrounding areas, some 15,000 applicants are waiting to move into low rental units, $9.6 million. Residential rehabilitation: the RRAP program had gained wide acceptance throughout Quebec, but all the Conservative Members from Quebec rose to cheer. 1 can hardly wait to see them face to face with the mayors. I can hardly wait to hear what they will reply when the mayors say that rehabilitation is fine, but who is going to pay for it? The people will pay, or else the city will be left with slums because this Government has decided to shelve that program.
The Minister responsible for housing sent us a press release full of statistics about the decline in rental housing starts. True, he said, we will look into that, it is important, the situation is deteriorating. He did look into it-he cancelled the program and withdrew $7.8 million. Who wants a press release! But that is not all, those cuts are only part of the picture. Quebec Members from the Lac-Saint-Jean region are aware of the $80.5 million cut in the Natural Gas Laterals Program. I can just see them telling their constituents that they support that. Then there are projects in the riding of Trois-Rivieres, in the riding of Lotbiniere, $4.9 million, and the Members . . . The President of the Treasury Board (Mr. de Cotret) tells me that they have been consulted. Fair enough, cut those programs out, there is no unemployment in our ridings.
And now, the National Capital Region. The National Capital Commission had several projects, but it so happens that the projects which have been dropped were in Quebec. The Members from the Quebec side of the Ottawa River rose and cheered, Mr. Speaker.
Another $3.5 million .. . The Vieux-Port in Montreal, the marina in Chicoutimi, VIA Rail cuts, all those projects were slated for the western part of Montreal and would have created jobs. Mr. Speaker, I fully expect that certain Members will wake up at the next caucus, because the people will give them an earful. I referred earlier to the cartoons dealing with the minibudget or the Throne Speech. I have another one with the Minister of Finance (Mr. Wilson), above the caption: Ladies and gentlemen . . . and showing knives stuck in ail the various expenditures the Government has decided to slash.
Concerning commitments, I would have understood that that party could not implement all its promises; this is normal. They could have done so over four years. But the shame of it is, they did the exact opposite of what they had promised. I would like to quote from an article by Gilbert Lavoie published in La Presse in 1979. 'From an about-face to another, election promises are made to be broken, said John Crosbie'. He is a Tory, and I am happy to see Quebec Members say: 'Yes, 1 fooled the people at home and I am happy.'
The Mulroney Government is no exception to the rule. It reneged on universality for social programs, which was held as a sacred trust by the Prime Minister during the election campaign but they are now preparing to throw that overboard. Mr. Mulroney and his ministers have tried to rebut the charge of reneging on one of their election promises; only, they forgot to agree between themselves on how to explain that. The Prime Minister admitted during a news conference that he promised not to tamper with universality, but he denied having reneged on his word, saying he was merely launching a public debate. One hour earlier, the President of the Treasury Board had said the Government was not tampering with universality because universality has been abolished with the introduction of child tax credit for needy families and the guaranteed income supplement for certain pensioners.
On Friday-according to Mr. Lavoie-the Minister of Finance had another explanation. He suggested Mr. Mulroney had only promised to maintain the universality feature of social programs for the less privileged. When the reporters appeared to be taken aback, the Minister, being a true gentleman, abstained from insisting. Such were Gilbert Lavoie's comments in La Presse. Mr. Speaker, not only were they satisfied with delivering a minibudget, but after creating unemployment and taking money away from the people, they put all that together and said: We are going to bring down their earnings, we are going to put them out of work, then six months after we are going to hire them back. From what we have saved, we will use a billion dollars to create jobs.
But there is something which is not bad which they have decided to do concerning new directions for Canada. Again, 1 thought they had promised to create jobs, but the title of the document is An Agenda for Economic Renewal. If that party had truly wanted to create new jobs, the title would have been
November 14, 1984

""An Agenda for Economic Renewal and Full Employment"". But this is merely window-dressing. There are two points which 1 should like to discuss concerning the so-called sacred trust principle governing social program universality which the Prime Minister and this government insisted upon. I, for one, deplore the approach of this document which aims at fostering a class war between Canadians earning $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or $500,000. When the Prime Minister wonders if a person earning $500,000 should be collecting family allowance-

What about the 2 cent increase on gasoline and fuel oil? The Minister is not likely to get hurt in his pocketbook. But the single parent family in his own riding will certainly be hurt.
On the other hand, to reply to his question concerning the $1 billion for job creation, what kind of jobs is it going to be? The Minister has stated that he would make no announcement, but it will be probably some kind of tax incentive for employers willing to hire young people. You know that thousands of businesses are not unionized. What is going to happen? They will lay off people 55 years of age and save money hiring young people. That will be the end result of your policy.

Member for Montreal-Sainte-Marie (Mr. Malepart), but 1 have a comment to make.
The Address-Mr. Malepart
As was pointed out by my colleague from Saint-Jean (Mr. Bissonnette), 1 am concerned to see that the Hon. Member has only negative things to say on behalf of constituents who are entitled to be well represented in the House of Commons.
As for me 1 simply want to comment on two points related to job-creation for young people. 1 am sick and tired of hearing that, in years past, the Opposition party boasted about creating a whole lot of jobs for young people. Recently, when I received the grants already allocated to my constituency of Verdun-Saint-Paul, 1 realized that these grants which were supposed to go to students for summer jobs were simply a continuation of Canada Works grants from past years. And who received them? 1 investigated and realized that most of them went to friends of the party. It so happens that I decided this year to advertise in the regional newspapers, and this had never been done before. I had never seen, in Western Montreal constituencies, advertisements saying that grants were available. I do not know if this was the case in Eastern Montreal, but in Western Montreal, this had not been done. As 1 do not want to take time away from other Members, I shall simply add that 11 times more applications were submitted this year and I have $300,000 more to give. Therefore 1 think that the money is coming from this Government. Our Government is doing this and I do not see any evidence of a cutback. Jobs will be created in the small constituency of Verdun-Saint-Paul, and there will be at least 150 of them because, for once, a Member of Parliament is working with groups of people and public servants instead of ordering officials to help his friends.

These jobs were important not only to help students make money, but because of the practical experience they could acquire in their work environment. Whatever the agency involved and even if this was an extension of another program, the purpose was to help the student, and the agency served the people. It is time for you to learn your job.

November 14, 1984
The Address-Mr. M. Tremblay Mr. Boyer: Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the Hon. Member for Montreal-Sainte-Marie (Mr. Malepart). It was not difficult to understand. It is clear that the Hon. Member proudly and strongly objects to unemployment, but I am not asking a question, I am making a comment, my friend. He speaks with the pride and enthusiasm of a neophyte who has just discovered a new problem. I wonder if he still holds the same opinion as when he sat on this side of the House. I wonder, Mr. Speaker, whether the Hon. Member is reflecting the views of his constituents with such a negative attitude about our new $1 billion program for job creation and whether he could set forth some concrete ideas and better suggestions in our national debate on unemployment.

Member's three questions. With respect to his first, namely if I had the same attitude when I was on the other side, I would say yes because if during the worst recession, the Liberal government had enforced your policies, we would not have a million and a half but four million unemployed. Within the caucus, some members like myself and some of my colleagues have fought and instead of reducing the deficit, the government created jobs to prevent undue hardship. That was the first question.
The Hon. Member then asked what were my suggestions. You said that you listened carefully to my speech. Suggestions have been made. Union leaders say that we should discuss reduction of working hours as a means to create more jobs. Would it not be worthwhile to set up an early retirement policy, to lower to 60 the retirement age so that the young could gain access to the labour market? There are many solutions and instead of challenging the universality of programs, it may be more advisable to deal with taxation.
Yesterday, I mentioned the tax indexation table. Who benefits? The rich. One billion dollars . . . The income tax indexation table ... A bachelor with an income of $7,500 saves $54. But a bachelor with an income of $100,000 saves $460. That is where they should get the money to reduce the deficit. Why 1 am so negative? Well, my constituents seem to think I do a good job, because in spite of the Conservative landslide, they put their trust in me, while as far as you people are concerned, anyone running for your Party would have been elected.

On this occasion, while I am both very proud and very pleased to be making my first speech as the Member representing the riding of Lotbiniere, I also feel some apprehension and at the same time a great deal of confidence in the future in undertaking my duties as a parliamentarian. Mr. Speaker, it is with great joy and enthusiasm that as a
citizen of this great country, I am ready to help find solutions to the problems that will be facing us, nationally, provincially and within our respective ridings.
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I wish to congratulate you on your appointment. I am sure that you will conduct the proceedings in this House with discernment, justice and equity for all. I should be grateful if you would also convey my congratulations to the Member for Don Valley West (Mr. Bosley), the Speaker of the House. Perhaps the Hon. Member remembers his visit to the riding of Lotbiniere. In any case, the people of Lotbiniere remember a bilingual gentleman, who is both fair and forthright, and also his quick wit and brilliant intellect, his absolute honesty and his parliamentary experience. My congratulations also go to all Members of this House who were able to win the confidence of their constituents and who are sitting in this Chamber at the beginning of this thirty-third Parliament. I am sure that we, the class of 1984, will benefit from the experience and advice of these senior Members.
Mr. Speaker, in keeping with the tradition, I would like to thank my constituents in Lotbiniere for their confidence in electing me as their representative in the House of Commons.
I can assure them that I will devote all my efforts and energy to state their views and their claims in Parliament. I would also like to congratulate the Canadians throughout the country who have made a sound choice when they heavily supported the representatives of a government of national reconciliation, for it is in those terms that the newspapers and other medias describe the new era announced in the throne speech. National reconciliation is what people seek at this juncture and Canadians have said so clearly in the last election. National reconciliation calls for change or renewal in many fields. Current priorities, as set forth in the Speech from the Throne, are designed to meet our requirements: economic renewal, social justice renewal and constitutional renewal.
Using my riding of Lotbiniere as an example, Mr. Speaker,
I intend to depict briefly our current situation with respect to employment, economic conditions, agriculture, federal-provincial relations, youth or senior citizens associations. Everywhere, people are worried.
Lotbiniere is a huge riding on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River. Our population is young despite the exodus towards more challenging labour markets. It is a partly urban, partly rural area. We have aggressive farmers, and some have the best dairy farms in Canada, but they also are worried. They have things to say to the federal Government. They remember that in the past they have been ignored at times, forgotten at other times, but they have been hurt by legislation and regulations passed without being consulted. They were quite often victimized by high-handed decisions coming from above, and certainly they are happy with this new Government's attitude. I am therefore committed to be a strong and efficient spokesman, and I feel sure that this new spirit of conciliation will be beneficial to all.
November 14, 1984

Certainly 1 will not forget our hog, poultry or grain producers who also at times are at odds with a finicky government. All these people getting their living from the farm are entitled to the decent income and the job security the Government can provide them through just and fair legislation.
Several other types of producers and breeders may also be found in my riding, Mr. Speaker, and in Saint-Apollinaire we have one of the very few rabbit abattoirs in Canada. This goes to show that people in my area are not afraid of going off the beaten track in order to break new ground and show their vitality in that area so vital for our economy. Whether it has to deal with a dairy producer in Warwick or a grain grower in Saint-Edouard-de-Lotbiniere, our government will make it its duty to be equal to his expectations. The Speech from the Throne indicates very well the spirit in which we will work in the future with local operators.
Mr. Speaker, in my riding we also have a very large number of small and medium-sized businesses. Incidentally, one of our communities, Daveluyville, has the largest number of industries per thousand inhabitants in Canada. But those industries, once thriving, have been hit hard by recession. The preceding government's policies have also contributed to their downturn. The employment crisis in the Bois-Franc area, in the very heart of the riding of Lotbiniere, is almost tragic.
The clothing, wool and textile industry which used to be the pride of Victoriaville, same sort of a regional metropolis of the Bois-Francs, is near bankrupcy. Just two years ago, that industry still employed over 4,500 people whereas today it barely survives with only about 1,000 jobs. The largest clothing manufacturers in the area were forced to close down.
As well, Victoriaville used to boast about being the capital of the furniture industry which has now almost disappeared from the area taking away the means of living of a specialized manpower.
Such disrupting facts about the economy of my region have been brought to light during various economic conferences held in the Mauricie-Bois-Francs area. We now have a chronic rate of unemployment which, for the past two years, has been twice as high as the average rate in Canada. All those who took part in the economic summits held in our area have been unable to find a sound solution to our problems.
Voters in our region seem to have found the answer, Mr. Speaker, in the trust they placed in the Members of the Government, which public opinion has already described as the Government of national renewal. The hopes of small businessmen are now raised because obviously the policies of the Progressive Conservative Government will favour the private sector, which is the motor of a healthy and dynamic economy. Our regional economy, which was based almost exclusively on soft sectors such as wood and clothing, certainly needs clear and specific policies. It also needs a general sense of vigour which will make it easier for consumers to purchase Canadian products of excellent quality.
The Address-Mr. M. Tremblay
As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Victoriaville area is the industrial core of my constituency. During the last few years, many industries have had to close down and to lay off hundreds of able and hard-working employees.
To solve this problem, the former Government chose to create temporary jobs leading nowhere. But, my fellow citizens are proud people, and like all Canadians, they want lasting jobs; they want to support themselves and their families with dignity without fear of going on unemployment insurance every three months. These are probably the reasons why so many community agencies were created; in other words, people have organized effectively.
The expectations of the Lotbiniere voters will not be left unfulfilled by this Government or by their Member of Parliament.
Along with the sad regional economic situation, there is anxiety on the part of the farming class in Quebec. The milking industry and maple plantations constitute the basis of that farming industry. Regretfully I must remind the House that there is a problem in this area in that producers are complaining about cost increases.

I should mention as well, Mr. Speaker, the role of the State in the generous distribution of its wealth through so-called job creating grants.
In this regard, I wish first to refer to a view expressed in a report published in La Presse on November 6, 1982, about the role of the Welfare State. One can read in this report those very wise comments, and I quote:
The State has grown out of proportions. It has overwhelmed in too many areas personal initiative and hence created an excessive dependency, thereby undermining all inventiveness, mutual help, family and community solidarity, etc. Group, class and regional interests have replaced sharing and mutual aid.
Community organizations and intermediary bodies have a particularly meaningful role to play in restabilizing our society.
During these times of economic and social crisis, we must support any local initiative intended to help people in need and to strengthen the life lines of the community.
Mr. Speaker, these are basic principles that we will put into practice when allocating the available funds of the State, which must cease to be viewed as the welfare State. Those who control the distribution of these funds or programs must not be guided by political capital considerations. The general interest must prevail at the time of the allocation over the particular interests of any individual or political group.
I will now say, Mr. Speaker, a few words on the federal-provincial constitutional relations as they stand in my province and in my riding. It is no secret that there is constitutional disagreement between the different levels of government in our country. It is inconceivable to think that Quebec is still not

The Address-Mr. M. Tremblay
part to the constitutional agreement. It is also inconceivable to see that the federal and provincial MPs of our region have not been able to co-operate in order to implement joint programs in the best interest of their constituents who are all full-fledged citizens of the same nation, Canada.
I am very happy to note the atmosphere of national reconciliation between Ottawa and Quebec and better relations among all government Departments.
[ Translation]
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to congratulate the Hon. Prime Minister who, faced with the concerns of young people, has appointed a Minister of State for Youth to deal specifically with their problems. This is an initiative that my constituents approve of.
1 would also like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the wish expressed by the Federation des personnes agees du Quebec, which has 175,000 members in Quebec and whose former President, Mr. Francois Urbain Roux, lived in my riding of Arthabaska. Their message, reprinted in the paper Vie nouvelle de I'age d'or, in the October 1984 issue, said in particular and I quote:
We ask you, Mr. Prime Minister, always to consult with the senior citizens of Canada before making any decision concerning them, because the builders of yesterday deserve the consideration and attentions of their sons, today's leaders, as the full citizens they continue to be.
I want to tell this House that senior citizens, their club with the largest membership of more than 2,200 in the province of Quebec being in my riding of Victoriaville, are concerned, and they would like to see a renewal in the social justice measures concerning them. I am assured that this government will be able to take their claims seriously. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to talk about the expectations of my constituents, and particularly about the hopes they put in this new government.

We are now dealing with an amendment to the main motion. Therefore, I have some assumptions about who may be voting in favour of the amendment. Given that assumption, the vote will begin with the Right Hon. Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition (Mr. Turner). We will then proceed in the normal way with that Party, starting with the Hon. Member closest to me.
Making an assumption for the moment about a potential other Party's interest, we will begin again with the Leader of the New Democratic Party and we will then proceed from the front bench to the back bench. If that Party were to vote against the amendment, we would deal with it after we have dealt with the Government.
Now we get to the complicated part. We will begin with the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Nielsen). We will then proceed as is normal, starting with the Member closest to myself on the front bench, then continuing with Members on the second bench, the third bench, etc. We will then proceed-
